# FFC Pay Batch Processor

## Description

FFC microservice acting as a Siti Agri adaptor to process batch files and send individual transactions as messages to an Azure Service Bus topic.

For how the repo fits into the architecture and what components or dependencies it interacts with please refer to the following diagram: [ffc-pay.drawio](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-diagrams/blob/main/Payments/ffc-pay.drawio)

# Prerequisites

## Software required

- Access to an instance of
[Azure Service Bus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/)
- Access to an instance of [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Optional:
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/)

## Configuration

### Azure Service Bus

This service depends on a valid Azure Service Bus connection string for
asynchronous communication.  The following environment variables need to be set
in any non-production (`!config.isProd`) environment before the Docker
container is started or tests are run. 

When deployed into an appropriately configured AKS
cluster (where [AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity) is
configured) the microservice will use AAD Pod Identity through the manifests
for
[azure-identity](./helm/ffc-pay-batch-processor/templates/azure-identity.yaml)
and
[azure-identity-binding](./helm/ffc-pay-batch-processor/templates/azure-identity-binding.yaml).

| Name | Description |
| ---| --- |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_HOST | Azure Service Bus hostname, e.g. `myservicebus.servicebus.windows.net` |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_PASSWORD | Azure Service Bus SAS policy key |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_USER     | Azure Service Bus SAS policy name, e.g. `RootManageSharedAccessKey` |
| MESSAGE_QUEUE_SUFFIX | Developer initials |



### Azure Blob Storage

This repository polls for files from Azure Blob Storage within a `batch` container.

The following directories are automatically created within this container:

- `inbound` - polling location
- `archive` - successfully processed files
- `quarantine` - unsuccessfully processed files

# Setup

The application is designed to run in containerised environments, using Docker Compose in development and Kubernetes in production.

- A Helm chart is provided for deployments to Kubernetes.

## Configuration

### Build container image

By default, the start script will build (or rebuild) images so there will
rarely be a need to build images manually. However, this can be achieved
through the Docker Compose
[build](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/) command:

```
docker-compose build
```

# How to start the Batch Processor

The service can be run using the convenience script:
```
./scripts/start
```

# How to get an output

There are several different possible outcomes depending on the input:

1. **Processing a valid payment file**  
**Input:** A valid payment file.  
**Output:** The transactions are logged, the payment file is moved from `inbound` to `archive`, and each valid [payment request](./docs/asyncapi.yaml) is sent to the Topic `PAYMENT_TOPIC_REQUEST`.  

2. **Processing a payment file with the wrong amount of requests**  
**Input:** A payment file where the amount of payment requests does not match the batch header.  
**Output:** An error message is logged and the payment file is moved from `inbound` to `quarantine`.  

3. **Processing a payment file with an invalid batch header**  
**Input:** A payment file with an invalid batch header (e.g. wrong date format)  
**Output:** An error message is logged and the payment file is moved from `inbound` to `quarantine`.  

4. **Processing a payment file with an invalid invoice line total**  
**Input:** A payment file where the batch header value matches the payment line values but one or more payment line does not match the corresponding invoice line total.  
**Output:** The valid payment requests are logged and error messages are logged for each invalid request, the payment file is moved from `inbound` to `archive`, each valid [payment request](./docs/asyncapi.yaml) is sent to Topic `PAYMENT_TOPIC_ADDRESS`, and an invalid event is sent to `EVENT_TOPIC_ADDRESS` for each invalid payment request.  

5. **Processing a payment file with an unexpected sequence number**  
**Input:** A payment file where the batch header sequence number is different from the expected value.  
**Output:** If the sequence number is lower than the expected value the payment file is ignored. If the sequence number is higher than the expected value the payment file is quarantined. A message is logged stating that the payment file has been ignored or quarentined accordingly.

`docker-compose down -v`  

# How to test the Batch Processor

## Running tests

Tests can be run in several modes:
- [Run tests and exit](#run-tests-and-exit)
- [Run tests with file watch](#run-tests-with-file-watch)
- [Run tests with debug](#run-tests-with-debug)

### Run tests and exit
